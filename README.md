Drunk 'n develop assignment by the Spirit. I tried to mimic the behavior from the [original Tetris](https://www.retrogames.cz/play_1751-DOS.php) behavior I used to play in DOS as much as possible.

No mobile support (yet). 

Tech: javascript, react, konva

Requirements: Jupiler
Soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqkzfrxJR6k , ...

Obviously needs refactoring.
- [ ] refactor Field.js into separated component files, extract consts into state
- [ ] make responsive
- [ ] add mobile support
- [ ] add ui design, animation and style
- [ ] extract create grid method and some other code duplication
